## Introduction

This is landing page project for Udacity. I have used Javascript and HTML CSS knowledge to do this project 

## CSS

I have given the class `active-sec` for active section. The section in viewpoet has the class `active-sec`.


## Javascript

1. I used link in the menu List and added the same ID as Section to it. Links are easy to control as we only have to add ID tag for the component to move to section 
2. For Hilighting active section I added event listener on window object `window.addEventListener('scroll',highlight)` . 
`highlight()` is the function used which checks the current active section and based on section. It will add and remove active class from menu items.
